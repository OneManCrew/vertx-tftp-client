# Vert.x TFTP Client
vertx-tftp-client is a simple  async tftp client which works with vert.x

The Following Java project implements the TFTP protocol and builds a TFTP client. Scope of the client is to upload and download files from a remote TFTP server.
I have used Vert.x to implement this project as asynchronously.

To use this component, add the following dependency to the dependencies section of your build descriptor:

Maven (in your pom.xml):
````
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.onemancrew</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-tftp-client</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
